# Bolt Quiz

##Game Idea: Bolt Quiz

###My reasons to choose this idea: 
Me and my friends love quiz games but most of them is not fun to play and doesn't have enough topics to have quizes on. For example, we love to play [QuizUp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quizup.core) but it's a fairly simple game and we don't feel challenged enough. Getting high on leaderboards is not rewarding as there is no reward mechanics so it's pretty much useless to be in Top 100. 

I want to design and publish a game that make the user try hard as possible to beat each other in game while learning about new topics and professions which is another thing why I'm upset about [QuizUp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quizup.core) being not fulfilling. 

There's a wide range of topics which both can be designed by users to challenge each other or loaded inside readily by the developers which makes the game complete which is good but game mechanics is not fun enough to play. There is 6 questions in a match and gives you 10 seconds to answer each. 10 points will be granted if its correct and 1 points for every second you saved. Last question gives you double points which is a nice mechanic but still not enough. And game shows an ad after every game to each user so when a match completes which takes a minute, 2 ads shown to 2 people. 

I want to change this game's mechanics to make it fun. Pretty much every quiz game works like this but I will change it to a brand new mechanic. Time can be changed but I think it will be 60 seconds to answer as much as questions as possible. Maybe another game mode won't even have a time limit so it will continue as long as noone has wrong answer. By this way not only knowing the right answer matters but being fast matters too. So I think it will be more fun this way.

I'm planing to continue to show ads after everymatch. I won't be annoying as players will wait getting to another game. By my calculations if 1000 users play this game. It will generate 1000 ads every 60 seconds. If players play 10 matches everyday, 1000 players will generate 300.000 ads and [average eCPM is $3.5](https://www.appodeal.com/home/blog/april-2020-mobile-in-app-ecpm-performances-worldwide/) so this app will generate $1050 ad revenue every month if 1000 players play this game 10 minutes a day.
