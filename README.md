My reasons to choose this idea:
I and my friends love quiz games but most of them are not fun to play and don't have enough topics to have quizzes on. For example, we love to play [QuizUp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quizup.core) but it's a fairly simple game and we don't feel challenged enough. Getting high on leaderboards is not rewarding as there is no reward mechanics so it's pretty much useless to be in the Top 100.

I want to design and publish a game that makes the user try hard as possible to beat each other in-game while learning about new topics and professions which is another thing why I'm upset about [QuizUp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quizup.core) is not fulfilling.

There's a wide range of topics that both can be designed by users to challenge each other or loaded inside readily by the developers which make the game complete which is good but game mechanics are not fun enough to play. There are 6 questions in a match and gives you 10 seconds to answer each. 10 points will be granted if it's correct and 1 point for every second you saved. The last question gives you double points which is a nice mechanic but still not enough. And game shows an ad after every game to each user so when a match completes which takes a minute, 2 ads shown to 2 people.

I want to change this game's mechanics to make it fun. Pretty much every quiz game works like this but I will change it to a brand new mechanic. Time can be changed but I think it will be 60 seconds to answer as much as questions as possible. Maybe another game mode won't even have a time limit so it will continue as long as no one has the wrong answer. In this way not only knowing the right answer matters but being fast matters too. So I think it will be more fun this way.

I'm planning to continue to show ads after every match. IT won't be annoying as players will wait for getting to another game. By my calculations, if 1000 users play this game. It will generate 1000 ads every 60 seconds. If players play 10 matches every day, 1000 players will generate 300.000 ads and [the average eCPM is $3.5](https://www.appodeal.com/home/blog/april-2020-mobile-in-app-ecpm-performances-worldwide/) so this app will generate $1050 ad revenue every month if 1000 players play this game 10 minutes a day.
